This article describes an architecture that enables multi-site, split brain DNS application hosting with applications being hosted on separate virtual machines all configured with a unique subdomain off a primary apex domain. All while ensuring network traffic between the Application Gateway and the backend application servers (VMs) flows through an Azure Firewall. Azure Front Door is used for external users and Application Gateway for internal users. This architecture provides high availability, scalability, and security for web applications hosted on Azure.

### Workflow

The following workflow (or dataflow) corresponds to the above diagram:
1. External users access the web application through Azure Front Door, which acts as a global load balancer and web application firewall. Azure Front Door routes the requests based on the client HOST HEADER to the Origin Group.
2. The Origin Group is configured to point to the Application Gateway while leaving the HOST HEADER unaltered. This is required so the Application Gateway can properly route the incoming requests to the various backend pools.
3. A Network Security Group (NSG) is configured on the Application Gateway subnet to only allow incoming requests from the AzureFrontDoor.Backend service tag. This ensures that public traffic cannot hit the Public IP (pip) directly.
4. The build pipeline runs on the PR.

### Components

  - [Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor): Azure Front Door is a global load balancer and web application firewall that provides fast and secure delivery of web applications to users around the world. It is used in this architecture to route the external users to the closest Application Gateway instance and protect the web application from common web attacks.
  - [Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway): Application Gateway is a regional load balancer and web application firewall that provides high availability, scalability, and security for web applications. It is used in this architecture to route the requests from both external and internal users to the back-end web servers and protect the web application from common web attacks.
  - [Azure Firewall](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-firewall): Azure Firewall is a cloud-based network security service that filters and logs the traffic between different subnets and networks. It is used in this architecture to control and monitor the traffic between Application Gateway and the back-end web servers, and to perform NAT for the outbound traffic from the web servers to the internet.
  - [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines): Azure Virtual Machines are on-demand, scalable, and configurable compute resources that run the web application code. They are used in this architecture to host the back-end web servers in an availability set, which provides high availability and fault tolerance.
  - [Azure ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction): ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider. In this architecture it is one of the options to facilitate private connectivity to the Application Gateway for on premise users.
  
### Alternatives

Some possible alternatives for this architecture are:
  - [Azure Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager): Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic routing service that distributes the traffic across different regions and endpoints. It could be used instead of Azure Front Door to route the external users to the closest Application Gateway instance. However, Azure Front Door provides additional features such as web application firewall, URL rewriting, and session affinity, which are not available in Azure Traffic Manager.
  - [Azure Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer): Azure Load Balancer is a network load balancer that provides high availability and scalability for TCP and UDP traffic. It could be used instead of Application Gateway to distribute the requests from both external and internal users to the back-end web servers. However, Application Gateway provides additional features such as web application firewall, SSL termination, and cookie-based session affinity, which are not available in Azure Load Balancer.
  - [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service): Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for hosting web applications without managing the underlying infrastructure25. It could be used instead of Azure Virtual Machines to host the back-end web servers. However, Azure Virtual Machines provide more flexibility and control over the web server configuration and deployment, which might be required for some web applications.

## Scenario details

This scenario was built to solve the problem of hosting a web application that needs to serve both external and internal users with high availability, scalability, and security. The customerâ€™s goals are to:

 - Provide fast and reliable access to the web application for users around the world.
 - Use the same apex domain name and URL for both external and internal users, without exposing the internal IP addresses to the internet while routing subdomains to different applications hosted on separate virtual machines.
 - Protect the web application from common web attacks and malicious traffic.
 - Control and monitor all network traffic between the Application Gateway and the backend virtual machines.
 - Ensure the availability and fault tolerance of the web application.

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

 - **Virtual machines**: You can use [Availability Sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview) to distribute your virtual machines across multiple fault domains and update domains within a single datacenter. You can also use [Availability Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) to distribute your virtual machines across multiple physically isolated datacenters within a region.
  - **Application Gateway**: Azure Application Gateways are always deployed in a highly available fashion. The service is made up of multiple instances that are created as configured if autoscaling is disabled, or required by the application load if autoscaling is enabled. You can also use [Zone-redundant SKUs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-autoscaling-zone-redundant#autoscaling-and-high-availability) to deploy your Application Gateway instances across Availability Zones and achieve higher availability and resiliency.
  - **Azure Front Door**: You can use [Azure Front Door Health Probes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/health-probes) to monitor the health and availability of your backend application servers and automatically fail over to healthy endpoints. You can also use [Azure Front Door Priority-based traffic-routing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/routing-methods#priority-based-traffic-routing) to distribute your traffic across multiple backend pools and optimize the performance and reliability of your web applications.  

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).
